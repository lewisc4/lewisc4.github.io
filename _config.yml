user_description: I have recently received my master's degree in computer science from the University of Massachusetts Lowell. I am driven by a deep passion for leveraging the power of machine learning to solve complex problems and make a positive impact on others. Specifically, my focus lies in the application of deep learning techniques to advance the fields of natural language processing and computer vision. Currently, I am seeking positions in these fields.
